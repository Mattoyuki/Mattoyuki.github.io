    <h2>What makes me... well... Me!</h2>
    <p>
        My passion growing up was always music. Music drove everything I did in my
        teenage years. I started learning the piano when I was six or seven years
        old and continued through my schooling to practice and perform. Combine
        this with being in the high school band, jazz band, and choir; and I would
        say music played a part in who I became. I learned to express myself
        through music because I found expression through words to be difficult.
        Music, however, gave me the chance to be me and show others who I was.

        I am also a person who loves to experiment and try new things. I am always
        wanting to try new foods, hobbies, games, musical instruments, ect. Trying
        new things it what helps me feel like I am living my life to it's fullest. This does have it's flaws though. I
        think I have committed
        to learning Japanese or drawing three times in the last year but keep finding new
        things to try instead of staying committed. But there is always the
        rest of today to try something again.

        I am currently studying computer science in the afternoon and evening.
        Combine this with work and my day is quite busy, but I find time for my wife and our two dogs when I'm at home.
        My world revolves
        around them. They are a part of who I am and I would not want it any other way.
        My past, my current interests, and my family are what make me... well... Me!
