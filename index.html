            <h2>What makes me... well... Me!</h2>
            <p>
                My passion growing up was always music. Music drove everything I did in my
                teenage years. I started learning the piano when I was six or seven years
                old and continued through my schooling to practice and perform. Combine
                this with being in the high school band, jazz band, and choir; and I would
                say music played a part in who I became. I learned to express myself
                through music because I found expression through words to be difficult.
                Music, however, gave me the chance to be me and show others who I was.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a person who loves to experiment and try new things. I am always
                wanting to try new foods, hobbies, games, musical instruments, ect. Trying
                new things it what helps me feel like I am living my life to it's fullest.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently studying computer science in the afternoon and evening.
                Combine this with work and my day is quite busy, but I find time for my wife and our two dogs when
                I'm
                at home.
                My world revolves
                around them. They are a part of who I am and I would not want it any other way.
                My past, my current interests, and my family are what make me... well... Me!
